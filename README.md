# boxWebpack
This is an educational project of Konrad Abe _(@kadlancer)_ to experiment on combining React, Webpack, Storybook and ultimately different kind of tests and CI optimizations as well.

## Prerequisites
node/npm is required to run this project. The rest is up to you.

## Getting started
Clone the project, cd to the project root and run:
 
    npm install
 
That should get you up and running. To start the storybook build/watcher, simply type:

    npm run storytime

To build a static copy of the project, you can use the script storybuild. The .out folder won't be comitted so the static build is for manual use only.

    npm run storybook

Thats it, Folks!
